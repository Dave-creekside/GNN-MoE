# Orthogonal Expert Training for HGNN-MoE

This implementation adds orthogonal expert training capabilities to your existing HGNN-MoE architecture, enabling experts to learn unique, non-redundant specializations while maintaining dense communication.

## üß† Conceptual Overview

### The Problem
In traditional dense MoE systems, experts may learn redundant representations:
- Expert A: focuses on syntax patterns  
- Expert B: also focuses on syntax patterns (slightly different)
- Expert C: focuses on semantics
- Expert D: also focuses on semantics (redundant)

**Result:** 50% of expert capacity wasted on redundant representations.

### The Solution: Orthogonal Expert Training
Force each expert to learn a unique "cognitive direction" in representation space:
- **Expert A:** Syntax patterns
- **Expert B:** Semantic content  
- **Expert C:** Pragmatic context
- **Expert D:** Discourse coherence

**Mathematical Foundation:** Experts learn orthogonal representations where `Expert_i ¬∑ Expert_j = 0` for `i ‚â† j`.

### Why This Works for Language
Language has natural orthogonal dimensions:
- **Syntactic structure** (grammar, dependencies)
- **Semantic content** (meaning, entities)  
- **Pragmatic context** (intent, implication)
- **Phonological patterns** (sound, rhythm)
- **Discourse coherence** (topic flow, reference)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration

### Beautiful Synergy with HGNN Coupling
- **HGNN coupling** ensures experts can **communicate** effectively
- **Orthogonal training** ensures experts have **unique information** to communicate

```
Before: Expert A (syntax) ‚Üê‚Üí Expert B (also syntax) ‚Üê‚Üí Expert C (semantics)
        # Redundant information flows

After:  Expert A (syntax) ‚Üê‚Üí Expert B (semantics) ‚Üê‚Üí Expert C (pragmatics)  
        # Each communication channel carries unique information
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Core Orthogonality Settings
```python
config = GNNMoEConfig(
    # Enable/disable orthogonality constraints
    apply_orthogonality_loss=True,
    
    # Loss weight (Œª) for orthogonality penalty
    orthogonality_loss_weight=0.1,
    
    # Loss computation method
    orthogonality_loss_type="gram_identity",  # or "cosine_similarity"
    
    # Aggregation across batch/sequence dimensions
    orthogonality_aggregation="mean",  # or "pool"
    
    # Gradual warmup (steps before full constraint strength)
    orthogonality_warmup_steps=1000,
    
    # Enable specialization monitoring
    track_expert_specialization=True
)
```

### Loss Types

#### 1. Gram Identity Loss (Recommended)
```python
orthogonality_loss_type="gram_identity"
```
- Encourages Gram matrix `G = E^T E` to approach identity matrix
- Target: `G[i,j] = 1 if i==j else 0`
- Strong orthogonality constraint

#### 2. Cosine Similarity Loss
```python
orthogonality_loss_type="cosine_similarity"  
```
- Penalizes high cosine similarity between expert pairs
- More flexible, allows for near-orthogonal representations

### Aggregation Methods

#### Mean Aggregation
```python
orthogonality_aggregation="mean"
```
- Average expert outputs across batch and sequence dimensions
- Stable, focuses on overall expert tendencies

#### Pool Aggregation  
```python
orthogonality_aggregation="pool"
```
- Compute orthogonality for each position separately, then average
- More fine-grained, captures positional variations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
cd hgnn-architecture
python test_orthogonal_features.py
```

### 2. Run Demo
```bash
python demo_orthogonal_training.py
```

### 3. Basic Usage
```python
from gnn_moe_config import GNNMoEConfig
from gnn_moe_architecture import GNNMoEModel
from gnn_moe_training import train_gnn_moe

# Configure with orthogonality
config = GNNMoEConfig(
    num_experts=4,
    embed_dim=256,
    coupler_type="HGNN",
    apply_orthogonality_loss=True,
    orthogonality_loss_weight=0.1
)

# Create model
model = GNNMoEModel(config)

# Training loop automatically includes orthogonality loss
stats, best_loss = train_gnn_moe(model, train_loader, eval_loader, device, config)
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analysis

### During Training
The training loop automatically tracks:
- **Total loss:** `lm_loss + Œª * orthogonality_loss`
- **Component losses:** Language modeling and orthogonality separately
- **Expert specialization metrics:** Every 100 steps
- **Warmup progress:** Gradual constraint strengthening

### Training Output
```
Epoch 1/5: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 50/50 [00:45<00:00,  1.1it/s, total=2.456, lm=2.234, orth=0.022, grad=0.85, tok/s=1250, lr=5e-04]
```

### Post-Training Analysis
```python
from orthogonal_analysis import generate_orthogonality_report

# Generate comprehensive analysis report
report_path = generate_orthogonality_report(
    model=model,
    stats=training_stats,
    output_dir="analysis_results", 
    config=config
)
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Start with Conservative Settings
```python
config = GNNMoEConfig(
    orthogonality_loss_weight=0.05,  # Start small
    orthogonality_warmup_steps=2000,  # Long warmup
    orthogonality_loss_type="gram_identity"
)
```

### 2. Monitor Expert Differentiation
- Watch orthogonality loss trends
- Check expert similarity matrices
- Verify specialization metrics improve

### 3. Gradual Constraint Strengthening
```python
# Phase 1: Light constraints
config.orthogonality_loss_weight = 0.05

# Phase 2: Medium constraints  
config.orthogonality_loss_weight = 0.1

# Phase 3: Strong constraints
config.orthogonality_loss_weight = 0.2
```

### 4. HGNN + Orthogonality Synergy
```python
config = GNNMoEConfig(
    coupler_type="HGNN",
    static_hyperedge_strategy="all_triplets",  # Multi-expert communication
    apply_orthogonality_loss=True,
    orthogonality_loss_weight=0.1
)
```

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Orthogonality Metrics
```python
from orthogonal_analysis import compute_orthogonality_metrics

# Analyze expert outputs
metrics = compute_orthogonality_metrics(expert_outputs)
print(f"Off-diagonal similarity: {metrics['cosine_off_diagonal_mean']:.4f}")
print(f"Effective rank: {metrics['effective_rank']:.2f}")
```

### 2. Expert Similarity Visualization
```python
from orthogonal_analysis import plot_expert_similarity_heatmap

# Visualize expert relationships
fig = plot_expert_similarity_heatmap(
    similarity_matrix, 
    title="Expert Similarity After Training"
)
```

### 3. Training Curve Analysis
```python
from orthogonal_analysis import plot_orthogonality_training_curves

# Plot comprehensive training analysis
fig = plot_orthogonality_training_curves(training_stats)
```

```python
orthogonality_level="weights"  # vs current "outputs"
```

### 2. Polarization Rotations

```python
apply_polarization_rotations=True
num_rotation_layers=2
```

### 3. Hierarchical Orthogonality

```python
hierarchical_orthogonality=True
orthogonality_scales=["local", "global"]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orthogonality Loss Too High
**Solution:** Reduce `orthogonality_loss_weight` or increase `orthogonality_warmup_steps`

### Issue: No Expert Differentiation
**Solution:** 
- Increase `orthogonality_loss_weight`
- Try `orthogonality_loss_type="gram_identity"`
- Verify `apply_orthogonality_loss=True`

### Issue: Training Instability
**Solution:**

- Monitor VRAM usage during training

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Use HGNN coupling** for best synergy with orthogonality
2. **Start with 4-6 experts** for clear specialization patterns
3. **Monitor warmup progress** in early training
4. **Generate analysis reports** to verify expert differentiation
